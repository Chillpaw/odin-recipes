This is the foundational project on the Odin Project to learn some HTML.

I ended up going overboard and learning/implementing some basic CSS too to make the website look nice.

Images used in this project were generated using OpenAI's DALLÂ·E and of course, all receipes are an homage to the Elder Scrolls V.
